# Installing Containerized Software on Alpine
## An RC Primer

Would you like to be able to move, share or publish your software without worrying whether it will work properly on other computers? Containerization enables software to be deployed and run across a range of computing environments (Windows, Mac, Linux) without having to be re-installed or re-compiled. In this hands-on RC Primer*, Research Computing staff will provide an introduction to building and running research software in containers using [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org), a containerization software that can be used anywhere and which is compatible with containers from other popular packages, such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

In order to follow along with the hands-on component of this workshop, youâ€™ll want to have a research computing account.

* _What is an RC Primer?: An RC Primer is a session that provide an introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. You can expect to leave "Primers" with an introductory-level understanding of the topic._
